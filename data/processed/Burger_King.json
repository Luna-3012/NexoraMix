  "description": "Burger King Corporation ( BK , stylized in all caps ) is an American multinational chain of hamburger fast food restaurants . Headquartered in Miami-Dade County, Florida , the company was founded in 1953 as Insta-Burger King , a Jacksonville, Florida –based restaurant chain. After Insta-Burger King ran into financial difficulties, its two Miami-based franchisees David Edgerton (1927–2018) and James McLamore (1926–1996) purchased the company in 1959. [ 5 ] Over the next half-century, the company changed hands four times and its third set of owners, a partnership between TPG Capital , Bain Capital , and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners , took it public in 2002. In late 2010, 3G Capital of Brazil acquired a majority stake in the company in a deal valued at US$3.26 billion. The new owners promptly initiated a restructuring of the company to reverse its fortunes. 3G, along with its partner Berkshire Hathaway , eventually merged the company with the Canadian-based coffeehouse chain Tim Hortons under the auspices of a new Canadian-based parent company named Restaurant Brands International .",
